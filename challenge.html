            <p><u>CONON MCGREGOR </u></p>
            HT/WT:- 1.75 m, 70 kg<br> DOB:- 14/7/1988 (32)<br> TEAM:- SBG Ireland<br> NICKNAME:- The Notorious<br> STANCE:- Southpaw
            <br><br> Conor McGregor rose from a tough neighborhood to become the biggest star in the sport of mixed martial arts (MMA). After joining the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in 2013, "The Notorious" unified the featherweight division
            with his title win in 2015, and the following year he became a two-division champion by winning the lightweight title. McGregor also famously fought boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2017. He abruptly retired from MMA in March 2019,
            before returning with a victory in January 2020.
            <br> Conor Anthony McGregor was born to parents Tony and Margaret McGregor on July 14, 1988, in Dublin, Ireland. Raised in the rough working-class section of Crumlin, McGregor enjoyed playing soccer as a boy before finding an outlet for his
            aggression in boxing. He was a member of the Crumlin Boxing Club from age 11 to 17, winning a Dublin Novice Championship during that time.
            <br> Signed by UFC President Dana White in early 2013, McGregor impressed with a first-round knockout in his April debut for the organization. He continued his winning ways through July 2015, when he defeated Chad Mendes for the interim featherweight
            title. That December, he knocked out Jose Aldo in a record 13 seconds to unify the featherweight title.<br> On March 26, 2019, McGregor announced via Twitter that he was retiring from the sport that made him famous, concluding his MMA career
            with a record of 21 wins and four losses. However, later in the year the fighter confirmed that he intended to make a comeback in January 2020. McGregor's return was a success, as he finished off American Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone with a 40-second
            TKO â€” the second-fastest win of his career, and his first victory in more than three years.

            <p><u>KHABIB NURMAGOMEDOV</u></p>
            HT/WT :- 1.78 m, 70 kg <br> DOB:- 20/9/1988 (32) <br> AKA :-(American Kickboxing Academy)<br> NICKNAME :-The Eagle<br> STANCE:- Orthodox
            <br><br> Khabib Nurmagomedov was born in Daghestan in 20 September 1988. He is a fighter of MMA (mixed martial arts) who is an expert in wrestling and judo. He was 2 world champion of sambo (= this is a mixture of boxing, judo, karate and
            lutte). In 2018, Khabib face Conor McGregor who involves his title, and Khabib won in the face of Conor. He is champion of the lightweight. I appreciate Khabib because he is humble and strong (27-0).
            <br> <br><br> Fighting style Nurmagomedov employs a wrestling-based style of relentless pressure against his opponents, often described as "mauling". Using a variety of wrestling and judo/sambo takedowns, he forces his opponents against the
            cage, and ties up their legs and an arm to prevent them from escaping. From this position, he exhausts his opponents by forcing his weight against them and attacks with measured strikes his opponents are often unable to defend. As of UFC 254,
            nineteen of his twenty-nine victories had come by way of either TKO/KO or submission. UFC referee Herb Dean stated Nurmagomedov constantly talks to his opponents during fights
            <br><br><br> Family Nurmagomedov married Patimat in June 2013 and they have three children: a daughter born 1 June 2015, a son born 30 December 2017, and a son born on 22 December 2019. The first son was named Magomed, after Khabib's great-grandfather.Among
            Nurmagomedov's cousins is fellow UFC fighter Abubakar Nurmagomedov. In May 2020, Nurmagomedov's father and long-time trainer Abdulmanap was placed in a medically induced coma after contracting COVID-19 following a heart surgery. He died on
            3 July 2020 at a clinic in Moscow, at the age of 57.
